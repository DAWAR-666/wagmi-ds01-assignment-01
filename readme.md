## üß™ Technical Specifications

### Data Structure Requirements:
- **Doubly Linked List**: Manual implementation (no ArrayList)
- **Stack**: Array-based implementation with fixed capacity
- **Queue**: Circular array implementation
- **HashMap**: Use Java's built-in for budget/category management
- **HashSet**: Use Java's built-in for category validation

### Algorithm Requirements:

## üìä Complexity Analysis

For each major operation, document:

- **Algorithm Implementation** (25%): Proper implementation of data structures and algorithms
- **Code Quality** (20%): Clean, readable, well-organized code
- **Testing** (10%): Comprehensive test cases and edge case handling
- **Documentation** (5%): Clear comments and complexity analysis

## üö® Important Notes

- **No external libraries** except Java standard library
- **Manual implementation** required for core data structures
- **Original work only** - this tests YOUR understanding
- **Handle all edge cases** - robust error handling expected
- **Document your complexity analysis** - show your algorithmic thinking

## üí° Success Tips

1. **Start with the data structures** - they're the foundation
2. **Test incrementally** - don't build everything before testing
3. **Handle edge cases early** - they're often forgotten until the end
4. **Use meaningful variable names** - your code should be self-documenting
5. **Draw diagrams** - visualize your linked lists and tree structures
6. **Time your algorithms** - see the performance differences in practice

**Remember**: This capstone project is designed to be challenging. It integrates everything you've learned into one comprehensive system. Take your time, plan carefully, and don't hesitate to revisit earlier concepts when needed. The goal is to demonstrate mastery of DSA concepts in a practical, real-world application.

**Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ**
